# Design Patterns in Modern JavaScript

This repo examines the various patterns that are part of the common lexicon of professional software engineers and provides concrete (yet non-authoritative) implementations using the latest features of JavaScript.



## Motivation

> _I don't even know what I don't know_

When first starting out whether as a self-taught engineer or first year Comp Sci student, the technical jargon and implicit concepts that exist in most discussions about application development can be daunting if not down right frighting.

This feeling of missing some requisite knowledge just so you can even be comfortable in knowing your confused has probably deterred many from pursuing this practice and I believe contributes to the dreaded, **imposter's syndrome**.

This repo aims to be an aide in distilling the ideas and providing functioning (not _functional_, there's already enough to cover  ü§ì) code examples.



### DISCLAIMER

**I am NOT, Grace Hopper, Mark Dean, Linus , Richard Stallman, Donald Knuth, Kyle Simpson, Angie Jones, Dan Abramov Sarah Drasner,.... (enter favorite Twitter personality)**

I am just a guy with a mechanical ‚å®Ô∏è, lots of  ‚òï and passion for both genuine understanding of concepts and sharing that understanding. A lot, if not **everything here could be complete hogwash** and should **only be used  as means to help facilitate your OWN explorations** on the topics covered.
